### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup

### What I learned

This project brought me closer to the end of the **JUNIOR** level. There's only one project left and a couple of days till the end of the year. Which means that I'm so very close to achieving my goal of finishing every challenge in this JUNIOR level. Not a lot to say about this project, the only challenge I had was the pattern img, but it wasn't much of challenge at the end of the day. One more challenge and I can call it a year!
